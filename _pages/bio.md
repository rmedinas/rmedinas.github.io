{{"

I have a master’s degree in Applied Economics from [El Colegio de la Frontera Norte](https://www.colef.mx) and a bachelor's degree in Economics from [Universidad Autónoma de Nayarit](http://www.uan.edu.mx). I currently work in the [Office of Planning, Research, & Institutional Effectiveness](https://www.sdmiramar.edu/campus/planning) in [San Diego Miramar College](https://www.sdmiramar.edu/). Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant with [Dr. Pedro Orraca](https://colef.academia.edu/PedroPauloOrracaRomano), [Dra. Eunice Vargas](https://colef.academia.edu/EuniceVargasValle) and [Dra. Erin Hamilton](https://sociology.ucdavis.edu/people/erh) in a research project about the implications of labor verification laws (E-verify) in the health of unauthorized migrants in USA.

My research interests are labor markets, technological change and health economics. Currently, I am working in a project that analyzes of the polarization of the labor market and technological change in a developing country as Mexico.
